# Introduction
This project was done in the context of a study module called "Procedural Art".<br>
Goal was to create scripts, which helped generate a procedural city or village, based on a chosen theme.<br>
The theme of this repository was Morthal, a village from the game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.<br>
All tools used were custom made, and are compatible to use within the editor of Unity.<br>
